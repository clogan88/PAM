# Galapagos Coral Thermal Tolerance (aka PAM)

### Overview

This project includes thermal tolerance data collected for two coral species (Pavona clavus and Polcillopora sp.) from the Galapagos archipelago. PAM fluorometry data, visual color card data, and red intensity data from normalized photographs were taken after a short term exposure to temperatures ranging from 12-35.5 degC using CBASS. Data were collected in March-May 2019.

### Data and Source Files

Original data files are stored as .csv files. A variety of analyses are included to examine differences between sites, species, and temperature. All code is written in R/Rstudio. 

### Project Status

This is a working project folder. More Soon!

### Contact

This data was collected by Dr. Cheryl Logan (clogan@csumb.edu) in collbroation with Dr. Margarita Brandt at Universidad San Francisco de Quito.
